# Satis example for Platform.sh

From getcomposer.org...

*Satis is an open source, static, composer repository generator. It is a bit like an ultra-lightweight, 
static file-based version of packagist and can be used to host the metadata of your company's private 
packages, or your own.*

This repository installs Satis on [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh).
